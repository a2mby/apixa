# v0.19.0 — Documentation, examples and migration guides

> **Planning only — not approved, implemented, or released.** This provisional backlog is deliberately stored outside `versions/` so it does not override the repository rule that only active/completed milestones receive frozen implementation folders. The A–F implementation decisions remain authoritative and unchanged.

## Status

Backlog / proposal. **Priority:** High. **Source:** Existing backlog.

## Goal

Make the final library discoverable and safe to adopt.

## Invariants

- Apixa Core remains framework-agnostic; integrations depend on Core, never the reverse.
- Existing A–F semantics and independent operation behavior remain intact unless a separately approved breaking change says otherwise.
- Types and runtime behavior must agree; no invented backend capability.
- Optional integrations may not add mandatory peer dependencies to `@apixa/core`.

## Upstream dependencies

- Stable public API surface
- Testing and package fixtures

## Open design questions

- Docs platform and automated snippet validation.
- Versioned docs policy.
